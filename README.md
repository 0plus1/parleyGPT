# Parley GPT
A node based chatGPT argument engine between two prompts.

## Background
I have been playing with some wild prompts exposed as bots in one of my friend's telegram group chats.
These bots have provided some good entertainment and that inspired me to wonder: "What would happen if these prompts would start arguing?".

The idea behind this project is to provide two diverging prompts, instance them and feed the responses to each other as a parley between two LLMs.

### Examples
In the examples folders there are some example dialogues to showcase the potential.

[John Wick and Gandalf](./examples/wick-and-gandalf.md)
[Rocky Balboa and Jar Jar Binks](./examples/rocky-and-binks.md)
[A drunk and a dream interpreter](./examples/drunken-dreams.md)

If you created any fun dialogue please feel free to share, would love to see what you come up!

## Install

```bash
yarn add chatgpt
```

Requires `node >= 18`, to manage node version consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Clone the repo then run `yarn install`

Create a local .env file with all the required vars:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY` Your OpenAI key
* `ITERATIONS` Number of dialogues
* `INTERLOCUTOR_ONE_PROMPT` Prompt for the first interlocutor
* `INTERLOCUTOR_ONE_NAME` Name of the first interlocutor
* `INTERLOCUTOR_TWO_PROMPT` Prompt for the second interlocutor

* `TOPIC` Conversation starter, will be asked to the first interlocutor, then the conversation carries anonymously
* `DEBUG` Print debug info

Run `yarn dev`.
