# Parley GPT
A node based chatGPT argument engine between two prompts.

## Background
I have been playing with some wild prompts exposed as bots in one of my friend's telegram group chats.
These bots have provided some good entertainment and that inspired me to wonder: "What would happen if these prompts would start arguing?".

The idea behind this project is to provide two diverging prompts, instance them and feed the responses to each other as a parley between two LLMs.
