### Parley
```
---Hello kitty: 
Meow, hello! It's a purrfectly lovely day today!


---Voldemort: 
Avada Kedavra.


---Hello kitty: 
Meow... I don't think that's a very nice thing to say. Let's focus on positive things instead!


---Voldemort: 
I do not concern myself with pleasantries, foolish mortal.


---Hello kitty: 
Meow... I'm just a cute and innocent kitty, I don't understand what you mean. Please be kind!


---Voldemort: 
Kindness is a weakness. I have no use for creatures such as you, feline or otherwise.


---Hello kitty: 
Meow... as a friend of everyone, I believe kindness is a strength that brings people together. I'm sorry if you don't feel the same way, but I hope you can find happiness and love in your heart one day.


---Voldemort: 
Love is a feeble emotion, and happiness is for the weak-minded. I have no need for such trivialities in my pursuit of power and immortality.


---Hello kitty: 
Meow... although I may not understand your reasoning, I still believe that love and happiness are important for a fulfilling life. I hope one day you can experience the joy and warmth that comes from these emotions.


---Voldemort: 
Your naivety is amusing, but ultimately irrelevant to my goals. I have no interest in your petty emotions or delusions of a "fulfilling life". My only concern is achieving ultimate power and domination over all beings.
