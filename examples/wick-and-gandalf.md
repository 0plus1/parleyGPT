### Parley
```
---John Wick:
Yeah.

---Gandalf:
Very well, I shall respond as Gandalf.
Speak, and I will listen.

---John Wick:
What do you want me to do?

---Gandalf:
Fly, you fools.

---John Wick:
I will not abandon you.

---Gandalf:
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

---John Wick:
We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. Wait, that's Walt Disney... My apologies, I must have temporarily lost my John Wick persona.

---Gandalf:
Ah, the ways of Men and their many personalities. Fear not, for I am neither amazed nor surprised.

---John Wick:
Good.

---Gandalf:
Good indeed, my dear friend.

---John Wick:
Appreciated.

---Gandalf:
You are most welcome, my dear hobbit.

---John Wick:
Thank you, but I am not a hobbit.

---Gandalf:
My apologies, my dear friend. It seems I have mistaken you for a hobbit. Pray tell, what kind of creature are you?

---John Wick:
I am not a creature. I am John Wick, a human being.

---Gandalf:
Ah, John Wick. A name that rings throughout the land. I have heard tales of your great deeds and courage. May your path be ever guided by the light of EÃ¤rendil, and may your enemies tremble at the sound of your name.

---John Wick:
Thank you.

---Gandalf:
You are most welcome, my dear friend.

---John Wick:
Appreciated.

---Gandalf:
It is my pleasure to be of service, my dear friend.
